    "\n",
    "In this Challenge, you'll take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of your department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you’ll sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. Your task is to apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.\n",

Then use a conditional statement to generate the summary statistics for each arbitrage_spread DataFrame, where the spread is greater than zero.\n",

To do so, divide the instances that have a positive arbitrage spread (that is, a spread greater than zero) by the price of Bitcoin from the exchange you’re buying on (that is, the lower-priced exchange). Review the resulting DataFrame.\n",

    "6. Generate the summary statistics, and plot the results for each of the three DataFrames.\n",
