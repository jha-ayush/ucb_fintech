# Using Roboadvisors to increase client portfolio

Existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

### Steps:
- Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
- Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.
- Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

### Submission:
- A Python script with your final Lambda function.
- Two short videos or animated GIFs that demo your robo advisor in action from the “Test bot” pane as requested.
