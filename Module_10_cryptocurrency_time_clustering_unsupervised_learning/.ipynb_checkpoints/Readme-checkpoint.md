# Crypto Clustering
Use Python financial analysis for unsupervised learning

Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.

create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors

clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. You’ll then plot the results so that you can visually show the performance to the board
