# Joint savings account

Build smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

Create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses to automate the creation of joint savings accounts.

These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. 

The features consist the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.


Step 1: Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

Step 2: Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM

Step 3: Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract
