# Joint Savings Account Solidity Smart Contract

This project contains a Solidity smart contract that creates a joint savings account, which can be controlled by two user addresses. 

The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement financial institution requirements for the features of the joint savings account. These features include depositing and withdrawing funds from the account.

## Technologies

**Solidity**: for creating the Ethereum smart contract

**Remix**: Ethereum IDE, for compiling and deploying the Ethereum smart contract

## Installation
